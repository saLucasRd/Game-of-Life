# Game of Life
This project is based on Conway's Game of Life, a mathematical simulation of cellular automata. The goal is to create an environment where living and dead cells evolve following simple rules, resulting in complex and dynamic patterns.

The game follows four basic rules:

1. Any living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies of loneliness.
2. Any living cell with two or three living neighbors survives.
3. Any living cell with more than three living neighbors dies of overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes a living cell (birth).

This project is being developed based on the ideas in the blog [Robert Heaton - Game of Life](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/).
